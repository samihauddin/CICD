#### What is CI/CD?
CI Continuous Integration (CI (focuses on integrating code changes and running automated tests))/Continuous Deployment (CD)(automatically deploys these code changes to production.

#### Why use it?

**Faster Time-to-Market:** CI/CD practices automate the process of integrating, testing, and deploying code changes. This automation significantly reduces the time it takes to move from writing code to deploying it to users, allowing businesses to deliver features and updates faster.

**Improved Code Quality:** Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines ensures that code changes meet quality standards and do not introduce new bugs. This leads to a more stable and reliable software product.

**Enhanced Collaboration:** CI/CD encourages collaboration among team members. Developers frequently integrate their work, fostering teamwork and communication. 

#### What is Jenkins??

Jenkins: tool that automates the building, testing and deployment of code. 

So imagine if you had to do a number of task to build a software like running and testing code, deploying the finished product. Doing this manually would be repetitive and time consuming.

Jenkins automates these tasks for you. It helps software developers save time and ensures the software is built, tested, deployed consistently, reducing errors and speeds up the SDLC.

#### What are the Stages to Jenkins?
- Create a Jenkins Job
- Build a Pipeline in Jenkins
- Link the Jobs in Jenkins

#### Alternatives to Jenkins
- circleci (only supports Linux and macOS)
- Bamboo
- GitLab
